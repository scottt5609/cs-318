        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>I want to be a computer programmer.</p>
        <h3>Junior</h3>
        <p>I want to learn about making websites. I learned in a previous class how to make a website, but I want to learn more about designing a website that will look good.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>My favorite things are basketball and traveling. I like to play basketball a lot and make Tiktok videos of me playing. I join pickup games on campus whenever people are playing. I also like to travel. Me and my dad have traveled to a few places in South America and Asia just recently. I also played basketball there too.</p>
