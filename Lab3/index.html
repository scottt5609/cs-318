<h2> Discussion of the intramural championship game </h2>
<p> This was a very intense game. The other team's average height was 6ft 6 and my teams average height
    is 5ft 4. My team's best player was ejected when he grabbed the rim and almost broke it. My best
    highlight of the game was when I got the ball and threw it from half court, and it almost went in.
</p>

<h4> What would I do better next time? </h4>
<p> No one was playing the point guard position. Everyone just grabbed the ball and threw it at
    the basket. No one was passing the ball, but another problem is that no one is open because
    the other team's defense was too good. My solution will be to run to the basket and dunk it
    next time.
